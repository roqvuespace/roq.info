# Station | Core Design

The core design includes a few important yet useful implementations. We will go for a modular appoach with mutiple connectable nodes for flexibility. This means each 'node' has it's own purpose and connection points. They all connect using a similar system, which will be spoken about at a later time.

The initial station could and will include the following 'pods'/'nodes':

Cargo : Designed for storing the goods, deviced and parts. Being one of if not the biggest pod.

Power Room : Designed for storing the power needs, for example the bateries for the solar capacity.

Docking Station : Designed for storing and boarding all the spacecrafts needed. With a modular design for mutiple spacecraft support.
