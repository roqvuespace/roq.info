# Station | Readme

At the time of writing this message (20/08/2025), the ISS is planned to de-orbit at 2030. Due to this matter, we have decided to globally launch our own space-station,
not ISS based, but made to serve Roqvue. This station is completly operated from Earth, without the need to send human resources constantly. 

Our station serves a important purpose, the purpose of handling, manufacturing and monitoring our space equipment. This space-station will be equiped with docking interfaces
compatable with mutiple spacecrafts, included but not limited to the Raven-1 & RavenXH.
