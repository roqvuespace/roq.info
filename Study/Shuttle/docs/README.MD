# Shuttle | Docs

Welcome the the official Shuttle documentation. This includes our high‑level documentation & reference material. 

The Docs folder containers a couple different folders:

1. `design/` : Our design choices and it's documentation. 
2. `launch/` : Our launch-site procedures, designs, references.
3. `references/` : Our references from third-party sources.
4. `data/`   : Raw data files (CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.).
5. `propellants/` : Fuel/oxidizer compositions, densities, specs.
6. `performance/` : Measured thrust curves, ISP tables, drag data.
7. `calculations/` : Self‑contained scripts & notebooks.
8. `fuel_mix/` : Mass‑fraction, mixture‑ratio, ΔV calculations.
9. `trajectory/` : Orbital mechanics, ascent profile tools.
10. `structural/`:  Load‑case and margin analyses.

> Note – Each sub‑directory contains a README.md that explains its purpose and lists the files it holds.
