# Metal Parts > Design

As you may know rockets and spaceships are made out of different types of metal and parts. With the main "part" being 
Aluminum Alloys. We will list some of the materials below, as reference, and explain why we have picked those:

Aluminum Alloys: Widely used due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and ease of fabrication. Common alloys include 2024 and 6061.
Titanium: Used in parts requiring high strength and heat resistance, such as engine components and structures that need to withstand high temperatures, though it's more expensive and heavier than aluminum.
Stainless Steel: Increasingly popular for certain rocket stages and components because of its strength, ductility, and heat resistance. Recent developments, like SpaceX's Starship, use stainless steel extensively.
Nickel-Based Superalloys: Used in turbine blades and high-temperature engine components due to their exceptional heat resistance.

All of those are equal and have their own level of importance. The most common material will be the Aluminum Alloys. But,
for high-performance and high-temperature components, titanium or steanless steel takes the spot.

Our spaceship, takes the advantage of mainly Aluminum Alloys, because of their strength-to-weight ration and the ease of fabrication. Which exact alloy isn't decided. We possibly need a variation of alloys. 

Sometimes the use of non-metal components are also viable, for example Carbon Composites, they are used for certain parts due to their very high strength-to-weight ratios.

In general, Carbon Composites typically consist of 80%â€“90% carbon and graphite, depending on how it's put together. Essentially
it's combined carbon fiber and resin, such as vinyl or epoxy. To create a composite material that has higher performance properties than the individual materials alone.
